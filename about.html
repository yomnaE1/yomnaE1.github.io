    <h1 class = "AboutLabel">About Me</h1>
    <p class = "aboutDescription">I am currently an undergraduate CS student, minoring in Data Science at <a href="https://www.odu.edu/computer-science" class = "ODU">Old Dominion University</a>.
     My academic background has provided me with foundational knowledge in programming and machine learning, all of which I 
     am using as an undergraduate student in an AI Studio Fellowship at Cornell Tech. 
     I am proficient in many languges including, but not limited to, Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. 
     My main areas of interest are in machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. 
     However, I am still open to exploring the facets that computer science has to offer. 
     As I continue to progress throughout my academic journey, my goal is to keep learning new skills and make new connections within the field.</p>
